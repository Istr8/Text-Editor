# Text-Editor
Prototype

This editor is pretty easy to run. Just run the python file, and start typing, since it doesn't have yet many features.

My editor is still in working. The blinking cursor looks a bit weird, but it's easy to see where the text will insert. I'll fix that.  
Another bug is that after you insert text, it overlays on the old one, and you have to press space and backspace to make it look normal.
But after that you got the text there.
